        <h1>To be Or not to be</h1>
        <p>
            To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
        </p>
